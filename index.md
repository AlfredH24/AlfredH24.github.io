### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    One of my favorite labs for computer science was lab 6 part 2. I specifically enjoyed part 2 and the guessing game we made. I thought the game was very simple yet fun and it used what we were learning properly. It reminded me of something that I would create in my personal time and I learned how to make simple games such as the guessing game. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 2 where we made a blackjack game is also one of my favorite labs. I already knew how blackjack works so turning it into a program made sense in my head. Still, I struggled with this lab by making it more complicated than it needed to be. It was a useful learning experience because eventually I did understand how the code was supposed to work. 

* Lab 8

    Another lab I enjoyed was lab 8 part 3 where we made animations. This lab stood out to me because it was different from the previous labs by creating animations. I thought the animations were entertaining to watch and I learned about using the sleep for function which helped me understand how the animations worked.
